This is a project to help me do a partial or full water change on my large 5" x 2" fish tank.
There is a smaller tank under the main fish tank that is used for the skimming system, this has a pump that returns the filtered water.
The setup. (can be seen in the setup diagram doc)
1. Mains water is conected to the input feed.
2. The feed is split to two valves
                 1/ To a pipe that goes into the sump "A"
                 2/ To a pipe that goes directly into the tank "B" (this pipe is used to syphon the water from the tank and can be used to fill the tank.
4. A ball valve is connected to the syphon pipe that leads to the outside.
5. There are two level sensors
                 1. Located in the sump to detect when the sump is full
                 2. Located in the main tank to detect when the main tank is full.
   The operation
   1. When a water change is requested
   2. Valve "B" opens for a second to prime the pipe leading into the tank
   3. The mains to the sump return pump is removed
   4. The ball valve is opened for a period of time depending on partial or full water change and the water is syphoned out of the tank
   5. After a time the ball valve closes and the valve "A" opens until the sump full sensor is triggered where upon it closes again
   6. The mains to the sump is returned for a time to allow the sump contents to be cycled into the tank
   7. This process continues until the main tank full sensor is triggered
   8. The sump is filled one more time to give water to cycle teh filter then the program terminates
